Personal Portfolio Project
This personal portfolio project showcases my skills, education, and projects as a web developer. The single-page website is built using HTML and CSS, featuring sections for About, Education, Projects, and Contact. I have used a nav bar for single page website as it will help in moving to the particular section of the page wihout need of excessive scrolling. The project highlights my journey and capabilities in web development, designed to provide a clear and visually appealing representation of my professional profile.
